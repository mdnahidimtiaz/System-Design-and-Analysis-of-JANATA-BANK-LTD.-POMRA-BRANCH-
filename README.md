As part of the Sessional Group Project for our System Design and Analysis course, we successfully finished the System Design and Analysis of JANATA BANK LTD. (POMRA BRANCH). The project included a number of crucial tasks:

>>Completing a thorough information collection process and classifying the data into different categories, such as Operational, Strategic, Tactical, and Statutory, in order to obtain a more thorough grasp of the bank's operations.


>>Creating use case and data flow diagrams (DFD) to assess and visually illustrate the bank's current procedures and systems.


>>Identifying a particular issue with the system and outlining two viable fixes, each supported by a thorough feasibility study to assess their viability and efficacy.

These steps were taken to provide JANATA BANK LTD. (POMRA BRANCH) with insights and recommendations to enhance their system's efficiency and functionality.
